- encouraging others to do the same (not to you but to yet others)
- attributes:
    - the most direct type of charity
    - easier to prove (harder to fake)

### Charity and Volunteering

- attributes:

    - amount of effort
    - quality of effort (physical, intellectual)
    - efficiency of effort

    - amount of benefit

### Corruptions

- giving Charity without attribution:
    - encourages theft of resources and reputation
    - discourages others to be Charitable
- taking from the many (instead of earning justly) to give to the few (reverse Robin Hood: robbing the hood)
- giving to those who will inflict pain on many others (e.g.: giving donations to the Nazi party)
- robbing to give (Robin Hood)
- not measuring the final benefit and continuing to give without Prudence
- benefiting few instead of many
- benefiting your own family or business partners instead of all who deserve
- benefiting those who do not deserve before those who do
- giving with other strings attached other than Virtues alone
