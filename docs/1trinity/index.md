# First Trinity: Truth, Beauty, Goodness

- [Goodness](../goodness.md)
- [Beauty](beauty.md)
- Truth

## History

### 1. Plato (4th century BCE) – the philosophical roots

In The Republic:

- The Good (highest principle)
- Truth as participation in the Forms
- Beauty as an objective, eternal reality

### 2. Aristotle (4th century BCE) – metaphysical refinement

Aristotle spoke of:

- Truth as conformity of intellect to being
- Good as the final cause of all things, The Unmoved Mover, pure actuality and ultimate cause

### 3. Plotinus & Neoplatonism (3rd century CE)

- The One is the source of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty
- Beauty is a sign of participation in the divine

All being flows from and returns to the One

### 4. St. Augustine (4th–5th century CE) – Christian identification

- God is Truth (not merely truthful)
- God is the Supreme Good
- God is Beauty itself (“Late have I loved you, O Beauty ever ancient, ever new”)

The Platonic ideas become explicitly theological.

### 5. St. Thomas Aquinas (13th century) – systematic formulation

The transcendentals:

- Being (ens)
- One (unum)
- True (verum)
- Good (bonum)
- Beauty (pulchrum)
