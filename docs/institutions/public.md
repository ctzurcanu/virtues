# Public Institutions

## Definition


A public institution is an institution that enacts the interest of the public.

## Rules and Principles

1. It is an [institution](index.md). (bound by the definition and rules of an institution)
2. It has a defined ethos or points to an ethos defined by the creator institution
3. Enacts all virtues up to the virtue level where it is meant to operate
4. Resolves all classes of challenges that are addressed to it
5. Integrates the work or witnessing by volunteers

## Implications

From definition: an intelligent being can take part of more than one institution.

1.1. and 1.2.
  - if forced to change name, identity: it still needs to do 6. for the previous identity
6.
  - has to prove integrity of content for each challenge and correct classification (maybe by a transformer encoder)
7. 
  - has to give credit to volunteers
  - if it is a public institution: has to give access to volunteers to any internal information

From all: the output has to be provable
