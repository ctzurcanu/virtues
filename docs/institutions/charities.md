# Charities

## Definition

A charity is a public institution that has as its main reason for its existence the enactment of the [virtue of charity](../charity.md).

## Rules and Principles

1. It is a [public institution](public.md). (bound by the definition and rules of an institution)
2. The resources accounting has to be public at the most detailed level (according to 1.1.3 and the fact that the output has to be provable)
3. It must maintain an external/independent public accounting/challenging of [goodness](../goodness.md) generated
4. It must recognize other charities in its domain and collaborate with them (unless proven impossible) 

## Implications

4. Collaboration means all (but not limited to)
  - making "competitor" charities known before accepting donations
  - following and amplifying their messages
