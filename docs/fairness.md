# Fairness

## Definition

- allowing your competition to have the same conditions
- fairness is not a virtue if the contest is not optional or is a matter of survival
- the rights and obligations deriving from being member of a defined identity: for example being an olimpic athlete gives you the right to demand that others do not interfere with your performance
