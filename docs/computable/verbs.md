# The Verbs as Domain of Virtue Computation

The link between Virtue and Action is almost self-explanatory. 

## 1. Statement of Principle

1.1 Virtues are not abstract ideals floating independently.  
1.2 They originate in **actions** — and linguistically, actions are represented by **verbs/predicates**.  
1.3 Therefore, verbs are the **root soil** from which virtues grow, and the **site of analysis** where virtues can be identified and extracted.


## 2. Why Verbs? (Ontological and Linguistic Grounding)

2.1 Every verb describes a **doing, undergoing, or becoming**.  
2.2 Ethics concerns **what we do** — hence, verbs encode the morally relevant material.  
2.3 Without verbs, there is no movement, no relation, no choice → no morality.  
2.4 Nouns (states, objects) may describe contexts, but verbs describe **decisions/events**, which are the proper domain of virtue.


## 3. Verbs → Virtue Extraction

3.1 Step 1: Identify an atomic action (verb instance).  
3.2 Step 2: Analyse the **valence** of that verb against the N axes (e.g., *to measure*, *to forgive*).  
3.3 Step 3: Extract the **virtue core** (e.g., *measuring honestly* → Truth/Measurability).  
3.4 Step 4: Record the mapping (colored coin issuance, proof capture, etc.).


## 4. Why Verbs are the Root of Virtues

4.1 **Universality**: Every culture has verbs; verbs encode what humans recognize as morally salient.  
4.2 **Granularity**: Verbs can be minimal (“to smile,” “to measure”) — enabling atomic moral analysis.  
4.3 **Compositionality**: Complex actions (wars, institutions) are composites of simpler verbs — thus decomposable into virtue vectors.  
4.4 **Proof‑friendliness**: Verbs denote observable acts, which can be recorded and proven (timestamp, evidence).  
4.5 **Cross‑tradition comparability**: Mapping virtues across religions and philosophies works only if we trace them to **common actions** (verbs).  
4.6 **Dynamic nature**: Virtues live in choices and habits → these are sequences of verbs, not static nouns.


## 5. Examples

5.1 *To forgive* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Mercy/Forgiveness**.  
5.2 *To trade* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Market (voluntary exchange)**.  
5.3 *To measure* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Truth/Measurability**.  
5.4 *To govern* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Governance**.  
5.5 *To compete* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Competition**.  
5.6 *To plant* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Continuity/Sustainability**.


## 6. Implications

6.1 Any system that ignores verbs risks **losing the root of virtue**; it becomes abstract, detached, or merely aspirational.  
6.2 By contrast, a verb‑rooted system ensures virtues remain **grounded in action**.  
6.3 This makes the 21‑axis framework both **spanning** (covers all verbs) and **provable** (every action can be assessed).


## 7. Conclusion

7.1 Verbs are the **source of virtues**.  
7.2 They are where virtues are **rooted, analysed, and extracted**.  
7.3 Therefore, the study of virtue must always begin with verbs — the primal seeds of moral reality.
