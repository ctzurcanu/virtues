# Representation of Virtues in Space

A proposed representation in space is in correspondence with the most used embedding spaces in the present:

## Compatibility with other Encoders

- a representation in 768 dimensions for compatibility with BERT-derived encoders

## in 21D

- by using a special encoder of virtue, using BERT-derived data

## In 3D

- a dimensionality reduction from the above

## in 2D

- by the reduction of virtues to 3 concepts

## in 1D

- by the reduction of virtues to 1 concept
