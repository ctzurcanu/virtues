# Hierarchies

## The Default Hierarchy

![Hierarchy](images/virtues-hier.png)

The linking concepts are:

1. Provable Hierarchy
1. Provable Goodness
1. Harmony, Generosity, Humility, Recognition, Greatness, Gratitude, Nobility
    - humility means recognition of the virtue of others
    - humility means: upon public recognition of one's virtues, accepting the minimum that is merited
    - greatness is virtue, recognized by others
    - "noblesse oblige" means the duty to recognize the virtue of others when your virtues are recognized
    - false humility is of 3 types:
        - rejection of others' recognition of one's virtues (when the virtues are factual) is false
        - being humble without being recognized
        - assigning a different value to the concept of "humility" in the hierarchy than its earned value
1. Forgiveness/Repentance
    - takes place only after Justice has been imparted
    - Forgiveness is dependent upon signs of Repentance from the guilty party
    - this action is the essence of Orthodox Christianity: one cannot spiritually digest the Eucharist without Repentance for all wrongdoings and/or solving all injustices one is aware of
