# Provable Goodness

## Definition

### Goodness

The apparition of the necessary conditions to advance from your position on the virtue dimension to a better state (in quality and/or quantity)



Goodness is always in respect to all Life. We consider the goodness applied to ourselves only because of the lack of required information about the others and the Life as a whole.
