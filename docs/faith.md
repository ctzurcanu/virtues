# Faith, Clarity of Implication, Reason

## Definition


- belief in the existence of concepts (things that cannot be perceived by physical senses). Example: the belief that circles exist as mental objects.
- belief in the existence of identity, relation, equivalence, and reference functions
- belief in the existence of perfections and the unicity of the "perfection of all perfections" that we may refer as God.
- belief in the existence of rational demonstrations (proofs)
- belief in the truth of axioms that are most implication-productive.
- belief in the existence of intelligent consensus. Intelligent consensus is eternal and is the substance of any perfection (is equivalent to God, in substance).
- the inter-dependence between Faith and Reason
        - Reason uses Faith as foundation
        - Faith uses Reason to gain importance
        - Faith can exist without Reason. Reason cannot exist without Faith (in the axioms)
