# Faith, Clarity of Implication, Reason

## Definition


- belief in the existence of concepts (things that cannot be perceived by physical senses). Example: the belief that circles exist as mental objects.
- belief in the existence of identity, relation, equivalence, and reference functions
- belief in the existence of perfections and the unicity of the "perfection of all perfections" that we may refer as God.
- belief in the existence of rational demonstrations (proofs)
- belief in the truth of axioms that are most implication-productive.
- belief in the existence of intelligent consensus. Intelligent consensus is eternal and is the substance of any perfection (is equivalent to God, in substance).
- the inter-dependence between Faith and Reason
        - Reason uses Faith as foundation
        - Faith uses Reason to gain importance
        - Faith can exist without Reason. Reason cannot exist without Faith (in the axioms)


## Dependencies

- Major
    - Charity: when one receives charity in the form of service or goods, it develops one's Faith.
    - Hope: Faith develops Hope (as Faith about future)
- Minor
    - Fortitude: Physical exercise develops clarity of thought

## Application

### Theorem 1: Proving the definitions of Virtues is of the highest Virtue

1. Proving the definitions of Virtues is the same as constructing a provable definition of Virtues.
1. Proving is part of the virtue of Faith, Reason, Clarity of Implication.
1. Discovering tentative definitions / new definitions are part of the virtue of Hope.
1. The process of constructing a provable definition consists of iterations of discovering and proving until the resulting proposition is both a definition and a provable construction.
1. A definition is the shortest description of the essence of an object. 
1. The objects that we are defining are abstractions. (Virtues are abstractions.)
1. The definition of an abstraction is integral part of that abstraction.
1. The definition of a virtue is part of that virtue.
1. Given virtue A and B, The combined virtue C of A and B (when by constructive interference) is more virtuous than both A and B.
1. Proving the definition of a virtue is the constructive interference of: Faith, Reason, Hope, and the defined virtue.
1. The action of constructing a provable definition is atomic.
1. This action is of the highest Virtue.

### Lemma 1: Constructive Interference of Virtues

Two virtues interfere constructively in a situation when:
- the virtues arrise independently
- when one is artificially increased the other one does not decrease


### Lemma 2: Atomic Action

An atomic action is the shortest description of the process for a result that is not attained by any other atomic action.


### Lemma 3: The Virtue of a Thing contains at least a part of the definition of that Thing


### Theorem 2: The complete definition of a Thing has to mention the Virtues of that Thing

1. By including the Virtues in the definition, the definition becomes more virtuous.
