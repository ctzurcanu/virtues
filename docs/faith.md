# Faith, Clarity of Implication

## Definition


- belief in the existence of concepts (things that cannot be perceived by physical senses). Example: the belief that circles exist as mental objects.
- belief in the existence of identity, relation, equivalence, and reference functions
- belief in the existence of perfections and the unicity of the "perfection of all perfections" that we may refer as God.
- belief in the existence of rational demonstrations (proofs)
