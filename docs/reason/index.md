# Faith, Clarity of Implication, Reason

![Faith](/images/faith.png)

- Top: True, Truth, Virtuous, ⊤
- Bottom: False, untrue, Non-Factual, Vicious, ⊥
- Intersection of:
    - Faith and Reason: Logos
    - Top and Bottom: Contradiction, Paradox, the Axis of Numbers
    - Top and Faith: Axioms
    - Top and Reason: Implication ⊢, Logic
    - Bottom and Faith: unfound Superstition
    - Bottom and Reason: Fallacy
- Other sets:
    - Reason \ Faith ⋂ Top = technē: know how (the laws of logic are in this set)
    - Reason ⋂ Faith ⋂ Top = epistēmē: knowledge

## Art

Artistic path of enriching the Logos:
- Nous (energy of intellect, intelligence)
- Guiding Wonder, Hope towards a leap of Faith
- Finding a solid ground in Faith, Axiom
- Mapping the new teritory in Logos
- links:
    - Art in Science: Empiric Discovery
    - Science of Art: Esthetics (αἰσθητικός aisthētikós)
    - Art in Production: Artisaning
    - Production of Art: Art Performing

## Science

Scientific path of enriching the Logos:
- Nous (energy of intellect, intelligence)
- Axioms or Logos elements: materia prima
- Logic: tools of implication
- (optional) other Logos elements
- (optional) Logic
- epistēmē: scientific knowledge, logically deducted Logos
- links:
    - Art in Science: Empiric Discovery
    - Science of Art: Esthetics (αἰσθητικός aisthētikós)
    - Production of Science: Academia
    - Science of Production: Applied Science

## Production

Technical path of enriching the Logos:
- Nous (energy of intellect, intelligence)
- Choosing the mapping and set from the Logos
- Using Technique (τέχνη tékhnē) to instantiate the knowledge or to perform an art
- Acquire knowledge of doing/implementing
- links:
    - Art in Production: Artisaning
    - Production of Art: Art Performing
    - Production of Science: Academia
    - Science of Production: Applied Science

## Consensus

![Consensus](/images/consensus.png)

Enriching the Logos by Consensus:
- Consensus about the definition of Consensus (Meta-Consensus)
- Provable mechanism of voting
- Timeless/Continous consensus contract
- Public availability of the results
- Ability to continuously challenge the results by verification and/or by re-voting

subtypes:
- consensus by Faith: when your opinion is rejected by the general consensus or when you do not know with clarity the reasons for your vote
- consensus by Reason: when your opinion is adopted as general consensus

## Ethics

Virtues implemented in Art, Science, and Production

## Definition


- belief in the existence of concepts (things that cannot be perceived by physical senses). Example: the belief that circles exist as mental objects.
- belief in the existence of identity, relation, equivalence, and reference functions
- belief in the existence of perfections, and the unicity of the "perfection of all perfections" that we may refer to as God.
- belief in the existence of rational demonstrations (proofs)
- belief in the truth of axioms that are most implication-productive.
- belief in the existence of intelligent consensus. Intelligent consensus is eternal and is the substance of any perfection (is equivalent to God, in substance).
- the inter-dependence between Faith and Reason
        - Reason uses Faith as a foundation
        - Faith uses Reason to gain importance
        - Faith can exist without Reason. Reason cannot exist without Faith (in the axioms)
- subtypes
    - Contemplation: contemplation, theōría, θεωρία: sensing Truth (by direct experience)
    - Discrimination: ability to establish the mental boundary for each Concept (Logoi)
        - Refinement: ability to navigate the Logos with very fine resolution
    - Rational Demonstration: ability to chain and join a set of previous Demonstrations using Logic



## Dependencies

- Major
    - Charity: when one receives charity in the form of service or goods, it develops one's Faith.
    - Hope: Faith develops Hope (as Faith about the future)
- Minor
    - Fortitude: Physical exercise develops clarity of thought

## Application

### Theorem 1: Proving the definitions of Virtues is of the highest Virtue

1. Proving the definitions of Virtues is the same as constructing a provable definition of Virtues.
1. Proving is part of the virtue of Faith, Reason, Clarity of Implication.
1. Discovering tentative definitions / new definitions are part of the virtue of Hope.
1. The process of constructing a provable definition consists of iterations of discovering and proving until the resulting proposition is both a definition and a provable construction.
1. A definition is the shortest description of the essence of an object. 
1. The objects that we are defining are abstractions. (Virtues are abstractions.)
1. The definition of an abstraction is an integral part of that abstraction.
1. The definition of a virtue is part of that virtue.
1. Given virtues A and B, The combined virtue C of A and B (when by constructive interference) is more virtuous than both A and B.
1. Proving the definition of a virtue is the constructive interference of: Faith, Reason, Hope, and the defined virtue.
1. The action of constructing a provable definition is atomic.
1. This action is of the highest Virtue.

### Lemma 1.1: Constructive Interference of Virtues

Two virtues interfere constructively in a situation when:
- the virtues arise independently
- when one is artificially increased the other one does not decrease


### Lemma 1.2: Atomic Action

An atomic action is the shortest description of the process for a result that is not attained by any other atomic action.


### Lemma 1.3: The Virtue of a Thing contains at least a part of the definition of that Thing


### Theorem 2: The complete definition of a Thing has to mention the Virtues of that Thing

### Corollary 2.1: By including the Virtues in the definition of any Thing, the definition itself becomes more virtuous.

### Theorem 3: Virtues and their instantiations can be proven

1. From Lemma 3.1: Everything that can be thought, can be thought clearly.
1. Virtues and their instantiations in reality can be thought, therefore defined (can be thought clearly)
1. Proving instantiations can be done by timestamped video/audio capture
1. The existence of virtues is proven by the existence of the words/concepts in the spoken languages and the definitions that identify the same concept
1. The proof for a concept being virtuous (or being a virtue) is by timeless consensus: we find it included (and applicable) in a set of spiritual traditions


### Lemma 3.1: Everything that can be thought, can be thought clearly.

From Wittgenstein's Tractatus [4.116](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php?title=Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_(English)#4.116): 
```
Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.
```
### Corollary 3.1: All virtues are reasonable

The provable definition of each virtue is an integral part of the virtue itself. In other words: the virtue of Faith/Reason is present in the definition of all other virtues.
