# Concepts

    - Legitimacy: right to execute governance derived from Faith (clarity of implication, representation), Prudence (optimization), and Justice
    - Duty: will and actions derived from Charity and Prudence that enable the existence of cardinal and supreme virtues. Pure Duty is not a necessity.
    - Freedom: the outcome of a virtuecracy. A virtuecracy is built on the efforts of Duty.
    - Tolerance: the virtuous side of Tolerance pertains to Prudence and the recognition of the fact that maximal optimization for eternity has not been achieved and anything that does not gravely impede virtues may be helpful to discover upgrades.
