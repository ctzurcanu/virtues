## Cited Sources Needed

**The following sections in the current documentation require proper citations from the above sources:**

### Urgent Citation Needs:
- `virtues.md` lines 10-47: Claims about quantitative nature of virtues
- `virtues.md` lines 121-354: All religious tradition mappings
- `faith.md` lines 139-190: Mathematical formulations about virtue
- `temperance.md` lines 11-12: Aristotelian virtue definition

### Cross-Cultural Claims Requiring Multiple Sources:
- All virtue equivalence mappings between traditions
- Claims about universal virtue structures
- Hierarchical arrangements of virtues

## Guidelines for Future Citations

1. **Primary sources first**: Always cite original texts when making claims about traditions
2. **Multiple perspectives**: Include different scholarly interpretations
3. **Cultural experts**: Prioritize scholars from within traditions when discussing their virtues
4. **Contemporary scholarship**: Include recent academic work, not just classical sources
5. **Peer review**: Prefer peer-reviewed academic sources over popular works

## Academic Standards Required

- **All factual claims** about religious or philosophical traditions must be cited
- **Cross-cultural comparisons** must acknowledge limitations and provide methodological justification  
- **Original theorizing** must be clearly distinguished from established scholarship
- **Expert consultation** required for tradition-specific content
