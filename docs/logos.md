# Logos

## Definition

A set of clearly defined concepts together with their links with the following characteristics:
  - there is no internal inconsistency
  - all virtues exist in the set and are linked with each other

## Ethos

A Logos that is specific to a person or a group. It contains in whole or in its main part definitions about what ought to be rather than what is.

## Person

An intelligent being who is ruled by only one Ethos. A human body can host more than one person and it usually does. That is the consequence of not having an internal continuous proof of the preeminence of only one Ethos (akin to polytheism or having maintaining multiple digital profiles with conflicting information).
