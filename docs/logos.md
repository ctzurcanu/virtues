# Logos

## Definition

A set of clearly defined concepts together with their links with the following characteristics:
  - there is no internal inconsistency
  - all virtues exist in the set and are linked with each other

## Ethos

A Logos that is specific to a person or a group. It contains in whole or in its main part definitions about what ought to be rather than what is.
An ethos of a person has to contain:
- all virtues that the person is aware of
- a full ranking of the virtues according to the person's point of view
- means for other persons to know and challenge or adhere to the ethos

## Person

An intelligent being who is ruled by only one Ethos. A human body can host more than one person and it usually does. That is the consequence of not having an internal continuous proof of the preeminence of only one Ethos (akin to polytheism or having maintaining multiple digital profiles with conflicting information).

## Ethical Transactions

A person can make ethical transactions only with another person with compatible ethos. The compatibility of ethos has to remain available to any challenge.

## Ethical Challenge

A claim about the ethos. The claimant will have to pay an ethical fine if the claim is proven to be false.

## Ethical Economy

The sum of transactions that are ethical. A person is a player in the Ethical Economy if has incoming and outgoing Ethical Transactions.
