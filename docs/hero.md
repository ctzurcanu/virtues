## Quality of Heroism

- Martyrs: those who sacrificed their lives in heroic action
- Heroes: those who have sacrificed some of their own non-renewable resources (great sums of money, one or more organs or functional parts of the body, important positions of dignity) to help others
- Volunteers: those who are helpful (donate their time and effort) but unpaid for their effort
- The Charitable: those who donate their hard-earned financial or renewable resources
- Mercenaries: those who are paid to act like a hero does and they perform the job: military, medical, civil servants, political representants
- The Money Launderers: those who donate to charities but have not earned the resources justly. Moral charities must research the money provenance and refuse immoral sources.
- Anti-Heroes: those who are paid to help others but do not perform their job or prevent heroes from performing their acts
