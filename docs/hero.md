## Quality of Concept

A hero is a defender of an idea. The idea may be more virtuous or more generally moral than other ideas. Some heroes perform their heroic deeds for mutually exclusive ideas. For example, they may be volunteers who fight for two countries who compete over ownership of a piece of land.
For establishing the hierarchy of concepts, we use the [hierarchy of virtues](hierarchies.md).


## Quantity of Sacrifice

1. Repeated Martyrs/[Bodhisattvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva): those who, after being martyred once, return again and again to help others with their message
1. Martyrs: those who sacrificed their lives in heroic action
1. Heroes: those who have sacrificed some of their own non-renewable resources (great sums of money, one or more organs or functional parts of the body, important positions of dignity) to help others
1. Provable Volunteers: those who are leaving themselves and their efforts to be denigrated by the public while able to prove their deeds
1. [Volunteers](volunteer.md): those who are helpful (donate their time and effort) but unpaid for their effort
1. The Charitable: those who donate their hard-earned financial or renewable resources

## The Anti-Heroes
- The Imaginary Super-Hero: those heroes that do not exist in reality. They intoxicate the minds with the wrong definition of heroism
- Mercenaries: those who are paid to act like a hero does and they perform the job: military, medical, civil servants, political representants
- The Money Launderers: those who donate to charities but have not earned the resources justly. Moral charities must research the money provenance and refuse immoral sources.
- Anti-Heroes: those who are paid to help others but do not perform their job or prevent heroes from performing their acts
- Denigators of Heroes
- Impersonators of Heroes: those who pretend to be the authors of a heroic act without the act existing
- Thieves of Heroic Acts: those who pretend to be the authors of an extant heroic act while robbing the true heroes of their due recognition
