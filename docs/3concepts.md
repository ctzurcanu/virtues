# Reduction of Virtues to 3 Moral Concepts

## The 3 Moral Concepts

- Empathy
- Governance
- Continuity: 
    - under Time: of life of the individual, of life of the species, of an emotion, of an idea
    - Timeless (Continuity of Eternities, of Causal relations): of institutions, of laws, of Concepts, Gods

## Application of Rule of Law

Rule of Law applied to:
- Empathy -> (social) Duties
- Governance -> (social) Rights
- Continuity -> (social) Contract

## Mentions

### In Judaism

‘What is hateful to thee, do not do until thy fellow man; this is the whole Law. The rest is commentary’ – Hillel the Elder, ca. 30 BCE – 10 CE

### In Christianity

Matthew 22:36-42:
```
36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’
38 This is the first and greatest commandment.
39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”
```

### In Principle

Relations:
- doing to others: Governance
- useful or pleasurable or virtuous to me -> therefore to others: Empathy
- Empathy can be: 
  - towards your future self
  - towards Eternities (such as God)
  - towards others
