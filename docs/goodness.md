The apparition of the necessary conditions to advance from your position on the virtue dimension to a better position/state (in quality and/or quantity)


Goodness is always considered with respect to all Life and all Time. We consider the goodness applied to ourselves only because of the lack of required information about others and all other Life outside of us.
