# Provable Order, Hierarchy of Virtues


## Definition


- an ordering of virtues that is provable by reason and/or by provable consensus
- is a type of [Arete](arete.md)

## Proof of Existence

Proof by Inhabitation:
- if an order does not exist in reality but the human civilization votes and respects the voted ordering: the ordering becomes real and with measurable effects
- an ordering of some virtues has been voted into existence already by the UN: the universal [declaration of human rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) in article 29.2 states that the personal virtues are less important than the virtues of the humanity as a whole

Proof by Reductio ad Absurdum:
- if such an ordering does not exist and:
  - an ordering is achieved by consensus: then the voters behave as if the ordering exists in reality, but a rational paradox is created
  - voting establishes that the order does not exist: all is in rational harmony
- if such an ordering exists and:
  - voting establishes that it does not exist: those who consider that the ordering exists maintain a rational basis for behaving according to the consensus
  - an ordering is achieved by consensus: all is in rational harmony
- since the presumption that an ordering does not exist leads to a possible situation that does not conform to the [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative), the ordering of virtues must already exist
