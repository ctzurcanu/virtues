# Virtues

## Definition

Virtues are not only qualitative concepts, they are quantitative. Because a perfection is not only characterized by quality, but also by quantity. Or: both quality and quantity have their own perfection and the common perfection is found at the intersection of the respective perfections.

We will name the lacking or the excess in each quality as Vices, and the mean as Virtues.

### Qualitatively
A virtue has to be considered using the following criteria:
1. Has to be as atomic as possible.
1. To have a constructive dependence:
    1. To not diminish other virtues.
    1. To compose positively with other virtues (addition).
    1. To have synergy with other virtues (composition that values more than simple addition).
1. To have a long-lasting outcome:
    1. To have an immediate outcome
    1. To have a long-term outcome
    1. To have an effect even on the past
1. Has beneficial effects at every scope:
    1. at individual scope
    1. at group scope
    1. at the Universe in general and to all life in particular
1. To have a dimension of measure where it occupies a mid-range. And the extremes are less moral.
1. On the dimension of measure: lack or be in excess in most cases.
1. Existence of instantiation:
    1. To exist at some point instantated in some scope (individual, group, life).
    1. To not exist in some (other) scope.
1. Indirection, definition:
    1. To have a name, concept
    1. To have a signifier, flag, symbol
    1. To be explained by ritualistic act
    1. To be explained by artistic depiction

### Quantitatively
We accept these definitions of virtue:
1. A range of values that are more beneficial than ranges smaller or greater.
1. A point in that range that maximizes the benefit according to the dimension of that virtue.
1. A point in that range that maximizes the benefit according to all virtues.

## Ethics

Virtues implemented in Art, Science, and Production

## Definition

- belief in the existence of concepts (things that cannot be perceived by physical senses). Example: the belief that circles exist as mental objects.
- belief in the existence of identity, relation, equivalence, and reference functions
- belief in the existence of perfections, and the unicity of the "perfection of all perfections" that we may refer to as God.
- belief in the existence of rational demonstrations (proofs)
- belief in the truth of axioms that are most implication-productive.
- belief in the existence of intelligent consensus. Intelligent consensus is eternal and is the substance of any perfection (is equivalent to God, in substance).
- the inter-dependence between Faith and Reason
        - Reason uses Faith as a foundation
        - Faith uses Reason to gain importance
        - Faith can exist without Reason. Reason cannot exist without Faith (in the axioms)

1. Proving is part of the virtue of Faith, Reason, Clarity of Implication.
1. Discovering tentative definitions / new definitions are part of the virtue of Hope.
1. The process of constructing a provable definition consists of iterations of discovering and proving until the resulting proposition is both a definition and a provable construction.
1. A definition is the shortest description of the essence of an object. 
1. The objects that we are defining are abstractions. (Virtues are abstractions.)
1. The definition of an abstraction is an integral part of that abstraction.
1. The definition of a virtue is part of that virtue.
1. Given virtues A and B, The combined virtue C of A and B (when by constructive interference) is more virtuous than both A and B.
1. Proving the definition of a virtue is the constructive interference of: Faith, Reason, Hope, and the defined virtue.
1. The action of constructing a provable definition is atomic.
1. This action is of the highest Virtue.

### Lemma 1.1: Constructive Interference of Virtues

Two virtues interfere constructively in a situation when:
- the virtues arise independently
- when one is artificially increased the other one does not decrease

### Lemma 1.2: Atomic Action

An atomic action is the shortest description of the process for a result that is not attained by any other atomic action.

### Lemma 1.3: The Virtue of a Thing contains at least a part of the definition of that Thing

### Theorem 2: The complete definition of a Thing has to mention the Virtues of that Thing

### Corollary 2.1: By including the Virtues in the definition of any Thing, the definition itself becomes more virtuous.

### Theorem 3: Virtues and their instantiations can be proven

1. From Lemma 3.1: Everything that can be thought, can be thought clearly.
1. Virtues and their instantiations in reality can be thought, therefore defined (can be thought clearly)
1. Proving instantiations can be done by timestamped video/audio capture
1. The existence of virtues is proven by the existence of the words/concepts in the spoken languages and the definitions that identify the same concept
1. The proof for a concept being virtuous (or being a virtue) is by timeless consensus: we find it included (and applicable) in a set of spiritual traditions

### Lemma 3.1: Everything that can be thought, can be thought clearly.

From Wittgenstein's Tractatus [4.116](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php?title=Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_(English)#4.116): 
```
Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.
```
### Corollary 3.1: All virtues are reasonable

The provable definition of each virtue is an integral part of the virtue itself. In other words: the virtue of Faith/Reason is present in the definition of all other virtues.

## Mentions

### In Classical Greek

"Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing." – Thales of Miletus (c. 624 – c. 546 BCE)

### In Zoroastrism

"That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself." Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5
"Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others." Shayast-na-Shayast 13:29

### In Hinduism

"One should never do something to others that one would regard as an injury to one's own self. In brief, this is dharma. Anything else is succumbing to desire." — Mahābhārata 13.114.8

### In Judaism

'You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.' — Leviticus 19:18

‘What is hateful to thee, do not do until thy fellow man; this is the whole Law. The rest is commentary’ – Hillel the Elder, ca. 30 BCE – 10 CE

- חֶסֶד Ḥeseḏ, [chesed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesed), Love, Compassion

### In Christianity

"Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets." — Matthew 7:12

"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise" — Luke 6:31

"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." — Galatians 5:14

[Matthew 22:36-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-40&version=NIV):

36. “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
1. Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’
1. This is the first and greatest commandment.
1. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
1. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

[1 Corinthians 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&version=NIV):

1. "If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 
1. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
1. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.

1. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
1. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
1. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
1. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

1. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
1. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
1. but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 
1. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 
1. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

1. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

- ἀγάπη agapē is translated as Love. It is possible to translate it more precisely as Empathy

### In Islam

"None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself." — An-Nawawi's Forty Hadith 13

### In Buddhism

"Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful" — Udanavarga 5:18
- [Muditā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudita): Empathy
- [Karuṇā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karu%E1%B9%87%C4%81) for negative Golden Rule
- [Mettā/Maitrī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB) for positive Golden Rule

### In Confucianism

'Zi Gong [a disciple of Confucius] asked: "Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?"
The Master replied: 
"How about 'shu' [reciprocity]: never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself?"' —Confucius, Analects XV.24

### In Taoism

"Regard your neighbor's gain as your own gain, and your neighbor's loss as your own loss." — T'ai Shang Kan Ying P'ien

### In Kant's Categorical Imperative

"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" — Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals

### In Principle

- doing to others: Governance
- useful or pleasurable or virtuous to me -> therefore to others: Empathy
- Empathy can be: 
  - towards your future self
  - towards Eternities (such as God)
  - towards others

# Friendship

## Requirements

- [defining your ethos](https://github.com/ctzurcanu/ethos)

## Evolution of Relationship

### Not Identified

When one of the parties cannot identify another.

### Stranger

When all parties do identify each other, but one does not know the ethos of another.

### Acquintance

When all parties know the ethos of each other.

### Debate Partner

When each party is welcoming being judged according to their own ethos.

### Friendship

When each party is allowing others to sustainably judge the party conform to the other's ethos

## Definitions

- the act of doing virtuous evaluation and communication of the results to somebody else
- the act of creating the best conditions for receiving such evaluation
    - making your main output known in detail
    - evaluating virtuous criticism with Temperance
- the act of improving yourself concerning Virtues as a result of virtuous criticism (from without as well as from within)
- the act of discovery and maintenance of a vituous (transactional) cycle between the involved parties
- attributes
    - clarity: a friendship has to be declared at start and finish. If it is not conscious, it is not friendship

## Types

- self-friendship: you are your own friend while you observe, evaluate, and act to improve yourself concerning Virtues. If done often: it is the most powerful friendship.
- active friendship: offering to act as a friend. A provable volunteer makes such an offering to the whole world every time an output is published
- passive friendship: acting as a friend when the other party is in an obvious need
- "maybe friendship": it is a friendship that exists only in the imagination of one or both parties. It may become friendship if tested. Its existence is not beneficial to the concept of true friendship.

### Ideal Friendship

- is not personal: is mediated by Virtues
- is unforgiving to transgressions of Virtues 
- is not dependent on time or space
- is a verb, not a noun
- is known to exist (or not) for each relationship
- is not dependent on reciprocation
- is dependent on output
- exists towards institutions too
- cannot be created or sustained by those who are unable to have ideal friendships with institutions or concepts that are defined without (not an inner/subjective definition)
- The institution above does not have to be common between friends, but each (of the 2) has to be known mutually

### Evolution of Friendship

#### 0: Common Characteristics

Some characteristics common to all stages of friendship between 2 parties (Alice and Bob):
- friendship has to be stated (known by both parties)
- it has to be mutual: if it is not mutual, it may be called admiration or "maybe friendship"
- it is more virtuous if it is made public (not a secret between parties)
- friendship is offered and withdrawn voluntarily
- the relationship of friendship is not a direct or personal relationship: it is with the virtues and having your friend as an intermediary
- the attachments that are developed are attachments to the virtues to the detriment of attachments to the person
- the friendship has to be sustainable. To cultivate at least one cycle of transactions in such a way that imbalances are resolved
- the most important part of the person of the friend is the ethos and it is the fundament for any friendship
- the ethos includes:
    - the personal God
    - [the hierarchy](https://ctzurcanu.github.io/virtues/hierarchies.md) of virtues/values
    - political reasoning and preferences
    - other components defined at [the ethos repo](https://github.com/ctzurcanu/ethos)

##### 0.1 Measurement

A friendship is measured only by distant members of the public (not known by any of the friend in that friendship). Ideally, by other friends (of other friendships).

The qualities measured are the virtues that are produced by the relationship/collaboration (not by the individual friends) for the benetit of all others (the public).

Therefore, an ideal friendship has to be:
- public
- with public (visible) output
- for public's benefit
- measurable

#### 1: Superficial

In this type of friendship, the 2 friends Alice and Bob allow each other the freedom to judge each other's actions according to the ethos of each: Alice is welcomed (even invited) by Bob to judge him according to Bob's own ethos.

#### 2: Moderate

Alice and Bob judge each other's actions according to both ethoses: Alice is welcome to judge Bob according to his own ethos (same as for the previous stage) as well as according to her ethos.
Another ethos is created: the ethos of the relationship. Judging according to the ethos of the relationship is always preferred.

#### 3: Deep

By the time the friendship becomes deep the friends will have changed each other's ethos so much that it will become one and their individual ethos will disappear into the ethos of the relationship.

- it does not apply to gaining of additional quantity of the same type of virtue, but of another type
- heroes cannot be imagined: heroism depends upon a real sacrifice

### Provable Hero

- a hero who can provide evidence or verification of the quality and quantity of their heroism

## Types

1. **Military Heroes**: Military volunteers who display valor and bravery in armed conflicts, risking their lives to protect their country and fellow soldiers.

1. **Civil Rights Heroes**: Volunteer activists who fight for social justice, equality, and human rights, facing opposition and danger to bring about change in society.

## Quality of Concept

A hero is a defender of an idea. The idea may be more virtuous or more generally moral than other ideas. Some heroes perform their heroic deeds for mutually exclusive ideas. For example, they may be volunteers who fight for two countries who compete over ownership of a piece of land.
For establishing the hierarchy of concepts, we use the [hierarchy of virtues](hierarchies.md).

## Quantity of Sacrifice

1. Repeated Martyrs/[Bodhisattvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva): those who, after being martyred once, return again and again to help others with their message
1. Martyrs: those who sacrificed their lives in heroic action
1. Heroes: those who have sacrificed some of their own non-renewable resources (great sums of money, one or more organs or functional parts of the body, important positions of dignity) to help others
1. Provable Volunteers: those who are leaving themselves and their efforts to be denigrated by the public while able to prove their deeds
1. [Volunteers](volunteer.md): those who are helpful (donate their time and effort) but unpaid for their effort
1. The Charitable: those who donate their hard-earned financial or renewable resources

- Denigators of Heroes
- Impersonators of Heroes: those who pretend to be the authors of a heroic act without the act existing
