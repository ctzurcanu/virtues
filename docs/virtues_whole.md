# Virtues

## Definition

Virtues are not only qualitative concepts, they are quantitative. Because a perfection is not only characterized by quality, but also by quantity. Or: both quality and quantity have their own perfection and the common perfection is found at the intersection of the respective perfections.

We will name the lacking or the excess in each quality as Vices, and the mean as Virtues.

### Qualitatively
A virtue has to be considered using the following criteria:
1. Has to be as atomic as possible.
1. To have a constructive dependence:
    1. To not diminish other virtues.
    1. To compose positively with other virtues (addition).
    1. To have synergy with other virtues (composition that values more than simple addition).
1. To have a long-lasting outcome:
    1. To have an immediate outcome
    1. To have a long-term outcome
    1. To have an effect even on the past
1. Has beneficial effects at every scope:
    1. at individual scope
    1. at group scope
    1. at the Universe in general and to all life in particular
1. To have a dimension of measure where it occupies a mid-range. And the extremes are less moral.
1. On the dimension of measure: lack or be in excess in most cases.
1. Existence of instantiation:
    1. To exist at some point instantated in some scope (individual, group, life).
    1. To not exist in some (other) scope.
1. Indirection, definition:
    1. To have a name, concept
    1. To have a signifier, flag, symbol
    1. To be explained by ritualistic act
    1. To be explained by artistic depiction

### Quantitatively
We accept these definitions of virtue:
1. A range of values that are more beneficial than ranges smaller or greater.
1. A point in that range that maximizes the benefit according to the dimension of that virtue.
1. A point in that range that maximizes the benefit according to all virtues.

# Provable Order, Hierarchy of Virtues

## Definition

- an ordering of virtues that is provable by reason and/or by provable consensus
- is a type of [Arete](arete.md)

## Proof of Existence

Proof by Inhabitation:
- if an order does not exist in reality but the human civilization votes and respects the voted ordering: the ordering becomes real and with measurable effects
- an ordering of some virtues has been voted into existence already by the UN: the universal [declaration of human rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) in article 29.2 states that the personal virtues are less important than the virtues of the humanity as a whole

Proof by Reductio ad Absurdum:
- if such an ordering does not exist and:
  - an ordering is achieved by consensus: then the voters behave as if the ordering exists in reality, but a rational paradox is created
  - voting establishes that the order does not exist: all is in rational harmony
- if such an ordering exists and:
  - voting establishes that it does not exist: those who consider that the ordering exists maintain a rational basis for behaving according to the consensus
  - an ordering is achieved by consensus: all is in rational harmony
- since the presumption that an ordering does not exist leads to a possible situation that does not conform to the [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative), the ordering of virtues must already exist

Rule of Law applied to:

- Continuity -> (social) Contract

## Mentions

### In Classical Greek

"Avoid doing what you would blame others for doing." – Thales of Miletus (c. 624 – c. 546 BCE)

### In Zoroastrism

"That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself." Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5
"Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others." Shayast-na-Shayast 13:29

### In Hinduism

"One should never do something to others that one would regard as an injury to one's own self. In brief, this is dharma. Anything else is succumbing to desire." — Mahābhārata 13.114.8

### In Judaism

'You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.' — Leviticus 19:18

‘What is hateful to thee, do not do until thy fellow man; this is the whole Law. The rest is commentary’ – Hillel the Elder, ca. 30 BCE – 10 CE

- חֶסֶד Ḥeseḏ, [chesed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesed), Love, Compassion

### In Christianity

"Do to others what you want them to do to you. This is the meaning of the law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets." — Matthew 7:12

"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise" — Luke 6:31

"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." — Galatians 5:14

[Matthew 22:36-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-40&version=NIV):

36. “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
1. Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’
1. This is the first and greatest commandment.
1. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
1. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

[1 Corinthians 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&version=NIV):

1. "If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 
1. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 
1. If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.

1. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 
1. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 
1. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 
1. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

1. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 
1. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
1. but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 
1. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 
1. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

1. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

- ἀγάπη agapē is translated as Love. It is possible to translate it more precisely as Empathy

### In Islam

"None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself." — An-Nawawi's Forty Hadith 13

### In Buddhism

"Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful" — Udanavarga 5:18
- [Muditā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudita): Empathy
- [Karuṇā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karu%E1%B9%87%C4%81) for negative Golden Rule
- [Mettā/Maitrī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB) for positive Golden Rule

### In Confucianism

'Zi Gong [a disciple of Confucius] asked: "Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?"
The Master replied: 
"How about 'shu' [reciprocity]: never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself?"' —Confucius, Analects XV.24

### In Taoism

"Regard your neighbor's gain as your own gain, and your neighbor's loss as your own loss." — T'ai Shang Kan Ying P'ien

### In Kant's Categorical Imperative

"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" — Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals

- doing to others: Governance

- Empathy can be: 
  - towards your future self
  - towards Eternities (such as God)
  - towards others

# Governance of Virtue

The training of such encoder for grading virtue has to be transparent and guided by all interested parties. Either by voting or by a mathematical proof.

We propose a continuous voting mechanism that guarantees a unique human identity for all voters.

# Representation of Virtues in Space

A proposed representation in space is in correspondence with the most used embedding spaces in the present:

## Compatibility with other Encoders

- a representation in 768 dimensions for compatibility with BERT-derived encoders

## in 21D

- by using a special encoder of virtue, using BERT-derived data

## In 3D

- a dimensionality reduction from the above

## in 2D

- by the reduction of virtues to 3 concepts

## in 1D

- by the reduction of virtues to 1 concept

# The Verbs as Domain of Virtue Computation

The link between Virtue and Action is almost self-explanatory. 

## 1. Statement of Principle

1.1 Virtues are not abstract ideals floating independently.  
1.2 They originate in **actions** — and linguistically, actions are represented by **verbs/predicates**.  
1.3 Therefore, verbs are the **root soil** from which virtues grow, and the **site of analysis** where virtues can be identified and extracted.

## 2. Why Verbs? (Ontological and Linguistic Grounding)

2.1 Every verb describes a **doing, undergoing, or becoming**.  
2.2 Ethics concerns **what we do** — hence, verbs encode the morally relevant material.  
2.3 Without verbs, there is no movement, no relation, no choice → no morality.  
2.4 Nouns (states, objects) may describe contexts, but verbs describe **decisions/events**, which are the proper domain of virtue.

## 3. Verbs → Virtue Extraction

3.1 Step 1: Identify an atomic action (verb instance).  
3.2 Step 2: Analyse the **valence** of that verb against the N axes (e.g., *to measure*, *to forgive*).  
3.3 Step 3: Extract the **virtue core** (e.g., *measuring honestly* → Truth/Measurability).  
3.4 Step 4: Record the mapping (colored coin issuance, proof capture, etc.).

## 4. Why Verbs are the Root of Virtues

4.1 **Universality**: Every culture has verbs; verbs encode what humans recognize as morally salient.  
4.2 **Granularity**: Verbs can be minimal (“to smile,” “to measure”) — enabling atomic moral analysis.  
4.3 **Compositionality**: Complex actions (wars, institutions) are composites of simpler verbs — thus decomposable into virtue vectors.  
4.4 **Proof‑friendliness**: Verbs denote observable acts, which can be recorded and proven (timestamp, evidence).  
4.5 **Cross‑tradition comparability**: Mapping virtues across religions and philosophies works only if we trace them to **common actions** (verbs).  
4.6 **Dynamic nature**: Virtues live in choices and habits → these are sequences of verbs, not static nouns.

## 5. Examples

5.1 *To forgive* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Mercy/Forgiveness**.  
5.2 *To trade* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Market (voluntary exchange)**.  
5.3 *To measure* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Truth/Measurability**.  
5.4 *To govern* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Governance**.  
5.5 *To compete* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Competition**.  
5.6 *To plant* → root verb; from it emerges the virtue **Continuity/Sustainability**.

## 6. Implications

6.1 Any system that ignores verbs risks **losing the root of virtue**; it becomes abstract, detached, or merely aspirational.  
6.2 By contrast, a verb‑rooted system ensures virtues remain **grounded in action**.  
6.3 This makes the 21‑axis framework both **spanning** (covers all verbs) and **provable** (every action can be assessed).

## 7. Conclusion

7.1 Verbs are the **source of virtues**.  
7.2 They are where virtues are **rooted, analysed, and extracted**.  
7.3 Therefore, the study of virtue must always begin with verbs — the primal seeds of moral reality.

# Charities

## Definition

A charity is a public institution that has as its main reason for its existence the enactment of the [virtue of charity](charity.md).

## Rules and Principles

1. It is a [public institution](institutions/public.md). (bound by the definition and rules of an institution)
2. The resources accounting has to be public at the most detailed level (according to 1.1.3 and the fact that the output has to be provable)
3. It must maintain an external/independent public accounting/challenging of [goodness](goodness.md) generated
4. It must recognize other charities in its domain and collaborate with them (unless proven impossible) 

## Implications

4. Collaboration means all (but not limited to)
  - making "competitor" charities known before accepting donations
  - following and amplifying their messages

# Relationship

![relationship](/images/relationship.png)

A relationship is a double transaction between One, Another, and All Else.

If a double transaction is between One and Another and it exchanges one higher virtue (higher than Idealism/Fortitude) for another, we may call this ideal friendship.

Now let us explore the virtuous relationships from the point of view of One:

- One gives (some quantity of virtue) to Another:
    - receives (same) from Another: Friendship, Trade Relation and, low to high:
        - all paid professions
        - (Fair) Competitor
        - Romantic relation
        - Marriage
        - Parenting
        - Extended family relations
        - Being a student and teacher on a lineage
        - Using the internet/AI: accepting to consume ads, having your content be used by the AI
        - Ideal Friendship
    - receives from All Else: Benefactor (to Another) volunteer:
        - Medic
        - Militiaman
        - Witness/Whistleblower
        - Parent
        - Teacher
        - Artist
        - Journalist
        - Mentor
        - Researcher/Developer
        - Priest
        - Hero
        - [Bodhisattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva)

- One gives to All Else:
    - receives from Another: [Mendicant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendicant)
    - receives from All Else: [Hermit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit)

- Another gives to and receives from All Else: no relationship

## Hope and Loyalty are the Differentiators

Between virtues:

### Timeless Virtues

1. Faith, Reason
1. Provable Hierarchy
1. Charity
1. Provable Goodness
1. Hope
    1. Sacrifice to Timelessness

### Human Virtues

1. Hope
    1. Sacrifice for Civility
    1. Education (unpaid)
1. Harmony, Generosity
1. Prudence
1. Forgiveness
1. Justice
1. Governance
1. Temperance
1. Fairness
1. Fortitude (Loyalty: Fortitude for the sake of)
    1. Loyalty to ideals/Idealism (for the sake of Human or Timeless Virtues)
    2. Loyalty to out-group
    3. Loyalty to Another

### Animal Virtues

1. Fortitude (Loyalty: Fortitude for the sake of)
    1. Loyalty to in-group
    1. Fortitude for the sake of personal Survival, Abundance, Recognition (Animal Virtues)
1. Competition
4. Measurability
5. Market
6. Abundance
7. Industriousness
8. Survival

## Vicious Relationships

- that do not implement the double transaction rule (thus being unsustainable or unfair)
- those that use vices as a transactional currency
- those that decrease the clarity and awareness of the relationship mechanics

## Hierarchy

Concerning virtues and vices, we can construct a hierarchy of relationships:

1. Ideal Friendship
2. Being a student and teacher in a spiritual lineage
3. Benefactor (see the types above)
4. Friendship (see the types above)
5. Marriage
6. Trade relation (see the types above)
7. Fair competitor
8. Mendicant
9. Hermit
10. No relationship
11. Pretended relationship / lack of clarity about the nature of the relationship
12. Peer pressure conformer
13. Peer pressure initiator
15. Beggar
14. Unfair competitor, enemy
15. Thief
15. Emotional manipulator/abuser
16. Initiator into vices
17. Robber
18. Traitor to One's resources
19. Physical torturer
20. Inflicting to One's body irreversible functional damage
21. Traitor to One's ideals
22. Assasin
23. Manipulator of proofs and history (about killing Another)
24. Manipulator of virtues (definitions, hierarchy)
25. Anti-Friendship: "friendship" that uses vices as a transaction currency

## Virtue -> Relation

## Relation -> Virtue

## Proposed Relationship

![relationship](/images/relationship2.png)

Inst A is Institution A or Social Contract A. Inst AB is the Contract that can operate transactions between Institution A and Institution B: their higher contractual authority.

If Virtues are encoded in the social contracts explicitly and the encoding is upgradeable, the civilization has improved chances for evolution as a whole.

# Logos

## Definition

A set of clearly defined concepts together with their links with the following characteristics:
  - there is no internal inconsistency
  - all virtues exist in the set and are linked with each other

## Ethos

A Logos that is specific to a person or a group. It contains in whole or in its main part definitions about what ought to be rather than what is.
An ethos of a person has to contain:
- all virtues that the person is aware of
- a full ranking of the virtues according to the person's point of view
- means for other persons to know and challenge or adhere to the ethos

## Person

An intelligent being who is ruled by only one Ethos. A human body can host more than one person and it usually does. That is the consequence of not having an internal continuous proof of the preeminence of only one Ethos (akin to polytheism or having maintaining multiple digital profiles with conflicting information).

## Ethical Transactions

A person can make ethical transactions only with another person with compatible ethos. The compatibility of ethos has to remain available to any challenge.

## Ethical Challenge

A claim about the ethos. The claimant will have to pay an ethical fine if the claim is proven to be false.

## Ethical Economy

The sum of transactions that are ethical. A person is a player in the Ethical Economy if has incoming and outgoing Ethical Transactions.

## Ethics

Virtues implemented in Art, Science, and Production

## Definition

- belief in the existence of concepts (things that cannot be perceived by physical senses). Example: the belief that circles exist as mental objects.
- belief in the existence of identity, relation, equivalence, and reference functions
- belief in the existence of perfections, and the unicity of the "perfection of all perfections" that we may refer to as God.
- belief in the existence of rational demonstrations (proofs)
- belief in the truth of axioms that are most implication-productive.
- belief in the existence of intelligent consensus. Intelligent consensus is eternal and is the substance of any perfection (is equivalent to God, in substance).
- the inter-dependence between Faith and Reason
        - Reason uses Faith as a foundation
        - Faith uses Reason to gain importance
        - Faith can exist without Reason. Reason cannot exist without Faith (in the axioms)
- subtypes
    - Contemplation: contemplation, theōría, θεωρία: sensing Truth (by direct experience)
    - Discrimination: ability to establish the mental boundary for each Concept (Logoi)
        - Refinement: ability to navigate the Logos with very fine resolution
    - Rational Demonstration: ability to chain and join a set of previous Demonstrations using Logic

## Dependencies

- Major
    - Charity: when one receives charity in the form of service or goods, it develops one's Faith.
    - Hope: Faith develops Hope (as Faith about the future)
- Minor
    - Fortitude: Physical exercise develops clarity of thought

## Application

### Theorem 1: Proving the definitions of Virtues is of the highest Virtue

1. Proving the definitions of Virtues is the same as constructing a provable definition of Virtues.
1. Proving is part of the virtue of Faith, Reason, Clarity of Implication.
1. Discovering tentative definitions / new definitions are part of the virtue of Hope.
1. The process of constructing a provable definition consists of iterations of discovering and proving until the resulting proposition is both a definition and a provable construction.
1. A definition is the shortest description of the essence of an object. 
1. The objects that we are defining are abstractions. (Virtues are abstractions.)
1. The definition of an abstraction is an integral part of that abstraction.
1. The definition of a virtue is part of that virtue.
1. Given virtues A and B, The combined virtue C of A and B (when by constructive interference) is more virtuous than both A and B.
1. Proving the definition of a virtue is the constructive interference of: Faith, Reason, Hope, and the defined virtue.
1. The action of constructing a provable definition is atomic.
1. This action is of the highest Virtue.

### Lemma 1.1: Constructive Interference of Virtues

Two virtues interfere constructively in a situation when:
- the virtues arise independently
- when one is artificially increased the other one does not decrease

### Lemma 1.2: Atomic Action

An atomic action is the shortest description of the process for a result that is not attained by any other atomic action.

### Lemma 1.3: The Virtue of a Thing contains at least a part of the definition of that Thing

### Theorem 2: The complete definition of a Thing has to mention the Virtues of that Thing

### Corollary 2.1: By including the Virtues in the definition of any Thing, the definition itself becomes more virtuous.

### Theorem 3: Virtues and their instantiations can be proven

1. From Lemma 3.1: Everything that can be thought, can be thought clearly.
1. Virtues and their instantiations in reality can be thought, therefore defined (can be thought clearly)
1. Proving instantiations can be done by timestamped video/audio capture
1. The existence of virtues is proven by the existence of the words/concepts in the spoken languages and the definitions that identify the same concept
1. The proof for a concept being virtuous (or being a virtue) is by timeless consensus: we find it included (and applicable) in a set of spiritual traditions

### Lemma 3.1: Everything that can be thought, can be thought clearly.

From Wittgenstein's Tractatus [4.116](https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php?title=Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus_(English)#4.116): 
```
Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.
```
### Corollary 3.1: All virtues are reasonable

The provable definition of each virtue is an integral part of the virtue itself. In other words: the virtue of Faith/Reason is present in the definition of all other virtues.

## Mapping

### Needs

#### 1. Physiological Needs
These are the biological needs that are required for survival. If these foundational needs are not met, the human body cannot function at its optimal level. Maslow considered physiological needs as the most potent of all, because they separate life from death, and have the ability to make the other needs appear as non-existent.

- Hunger
- Thirst
- Sexual Desire
- Maternal Responses
- Homeostasis

#### 2. Safety Needs
If physiological needs are relatively well satisfied, a new set of needs emerges, which Maslow classifies as Safety Needs. These needs include:

- Insulation from Threats
- Seeking Stability (Predictability)

#### 3. Love Needs
If the previous two needs (physiological and safety) are well gratified, the next set of needs that would arise are love based needs:

- Love & Affection
- Belongingness
- Friendship
- Mate
- Children

#### 4. Esteem Needs
Maslow says that all people (except for a few pathological exceptions) in our society have a need or desire for a stable and high evaluation of themselves. This evaluation of self would be based on real capacity, achievement and respect from others, it is comprised of the following:

- Self-Respect
- Self-Esteem
- Esteem from Others
- Strength
- Achievement
- Independence
- Freedom
- Prestige

#### 5. Self-Actualization
A desire to be all one can be. Self-actualization needs can come in the forms of:

- A Search for Knowledge
- Desire for Truth and Wisdom
- An Urge to Solve Cosmic Mysteries

### Characteristics of Self-Actualized Individuals

#### 1. Accurate perception of reality
Self-actualizing people have an unusual ability to detect the spurious, the fake, and the dishonest in personality, and in general to judge people correctly and efficiently.

#### 2. Acceptance of Self, Others and Nature
They can accept their own human nature, with all its shortcomings, with all its discrepancies from the ideal image without feeling real concern.

#### 3. Spontaneity; Simplicity; Naturalness 
Their behavior is marked by simplicity and naturalness, and by lack of artificiality or straining for effect. His unconventionality is not superficial but essential or internal… and he is perhaps more human, more revealing of the original nature of the species.

#### 4. Problem Centering
Self-actualizing people are in general strongly focused on problems outside themselves… they are not generally much concerned about themselves… These individuals customarily have some mission in life, some task to fulfill, some problem outside themselves which enlists much of their energies.

#### 5. The Quality of Detachment; The Need for Privacy
For all my subjects it is true that they can be solitary without harm to themselves and without discomfort… it is true for almost all that they positively like solitude and privacy to a definite greater degree than the average person.

#### 6. Autonomy (Independence of Culture and Environment) 
Self-actualized people are not dependent for their main satisfactions on the real world, or other people or culture or means to ends or, in general, on extrinsic satisfactions. Rather they are dependent for their own development and continued growth of their own potentialities.

#### 7. Continued Freshness of Appreciation
Self-actualizing people have the wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder and even ecstasy, however stale these experiences may have become to others… for such a person, any sunset may be as beautiful as the first one.

#### 8. Mystic Experiences (Peak Experiences)
Feelings of limitless horizons opening up to the vision, the feeling of being simultaneously more powerful and also more helpless than one ever was before, the feeling of great ecstasy and wonder and awe, the loss of placing in time and space with, finally, the conviction that something extremely important and valuable had happened.
Peaking self-actualized people tend to live in a realm of being; of poetry, esthetics; symbols; transcendence, “religion” of the mystical, personal, non-institutional sort; and of end-experiences.

#### 9. Human kinship / Gemeinschaftsgegühl 
Self-actualizing people have for human beings in general a deep feeling of identification, sympathy, and affection in spite of the occasional anger, impatience, or disgust… because of this they have a genuine desire to help the human race as if they were all members of a single family.

#### 10. Humility and respect for others

#### 11. Deep interpersonal relationships with a select few people 10. Interpersonal Relations
Self actualizing people have deeper and more profound interpersonal relations than any other adults (although not necessarily deeper than those of children.) They are capable of more fusion, greater love, more perfect identification, more obliteration of the ego boundaries than other people would consider possible.

#### 11. The Democratic Character Structure 
All my subjects may be said to be democratic people in the deepest possible sense… they can be and are friendly with anyone of a suitable character regardless of class, education, political belief, race or color… it is as if they are not even aware of these differences.” (Maslow, 1970). These individuals often select friends of an elite nature, thought not elite in birthright, race or color; but rather eliteness of character, capacity and talent.

#### 12. Strong but not necessarily conventional ethical standards 12. Discrimination Between Good and Evil
These individuals are strongly ethical, they have definite moral standards, they do right and do not do wrong. Needless to say, their notions of right and wrong and good and evil are often not the conventional ones.

#### 13. Focuses on ends rather than means

#### 14. Nonhostile sense of humor 13. Philosophical, Un-Hostile Sense of Humor
“Their sense of humor is not of the ordinary type. They do not consider funny what the average man considers to be funny. They do not laugh at hostile humor or superiority humor… characteristically what they consider humor is more closely allied to philosophy than anything else… more akin to parables or fables.

#### 14. Creativeness 
Each one shows in one way or another a special kind of creativeness or originality or inventiveness that has certain peculiar characteristics… which is akin to the universal creativeness of unspoiled children.

#### 15. The Transcendence of Culture; Resistance to Enculturation
“Self-actualizing people are not well adjusted (in the naive sense of approval of and identification with the culture). They get along with the culture in various ways, but of all of them it may be said that in a certain profound and meaningful sense they resist enculturation and maintain inner detachment from the culture in which they are immersed.

# Values in Action Inventory (VIA)

## Sources

- the landmark book: [Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths-and-virtues) by Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman.

## Classification, Definitions

### Wisdom

#### Creativity

"I am creative, conceptualizing something useful, coming up with ideas that result in something worthwhile."

- Original & Adaptive
- Clever
- A problem solver
- Sees and does things in different ways

Creativity is thinking of new ways to do things. It involves producing ideas or behaviors that are original. However, originality is not enough: whatever is created, whether an idea or a product, must also be useful or adaptable. For example, you might write a blog post that is unique because it is entirely gibberish. That’s not going to be useful, so it would not be considered creative.

There are two essential components to Creativity- originality and adaptiveness. A creative individual generates ideas or behaviors that are novel or unusual and these make a positive contribution to the individual's life or the lives of others group.

#### Curiosity
“I seek out situations where I gain new experiences without getting in my own or other people’s way.”

- Interested
- Explores new things
- Open to new ideas

To be curious is to explore and discover, to take an interest in ongoing experience for its own sake. Curiosity is often described as novelty-seeking and being open to experience, and it’s associated with the natural desire to build knowledge. It is fulfilling to journey toward an answer, to engage in a new experience, or to learn a new fact. To go to a new restaurant, visit a new city, meet a new person in your class, or to conduct an online search for a question can each fulfill your quest for new experiences and new information.

There are two key components to curious individuals: They are interested in exploring new ideas, activities and experiences, and they also have a strong desire to increase their own personal knowledge.

#### Judgment
"I weigh all aspects objectively in making decisions, including arguments that are in conflict with my convictions."

- A critical thinker
- Thinks things through
- Open minded

Judgment involves making rational and logical choices, and analytically evaluating ideas, opinions, and facts. To use a term that originally came from outside the character field: it is critical thinking, weighing the evidence fairly, thinking things through, and examining the evidence from all sides rather than jumping to conclusions. Judgment also involves being open-minded and able to change one’s mind in the light of evidence, remaining open to other arguments and perspectives. It should be clear at this point that judgment is a core “strength of the head” — it’s a very thinking-oriented character strength.

The strength of judgment is a corrective strength in that it counteracts faulty thinking, such as favoring your current views or favoring ideas that are considered the dominant view, and therefore giving less attention to the less-dominant view. It is the willingness to search actively for evidence against your favored beliefs, plans or goals and to weigh all of the evidence fairly when it is available.

#### Love of Learning
"I am motivated to acquire new levels of knowledge, or deepen my existing knowledge or skills in a significant way."

- Masters new skills & topics
- Systematically adds to knowledge

Love of learning means a passion for learning, a desire to learn just for learning’s sake. In fact, curiosity and love of learning are among the most closely related strengths in the VIA Classification. They can still be distinguished though. While curiosity is the motivating force that leads you to seek out new information, love of learning refers to the desire to hold on to and deepen that information. The curious person is motivated by the pursuit of knowledge; the person who loves learning is motivated by the expansion of their fund of knowledge. Where curiosity is often associated with a great deal of energy and a drive to gather information, the lover of learning is often more contemplative. Love of learning describes the way in which a person engages new information and skills. Love of learning is a strength that teachers would like to see in their students, parents want to encourage in their children, therapists support in their clients, and employers try to foster in their employees. It has important motivational consequences because it helps people persist through challenges, setbacks and negative feedback.

#### Perspective
"I give advice to others by considering different (and relevant) perspectives and using my own experiences and knowledge to clarify the big picture."

- Wise
- Provides wise counsel
- Takes the big picture view

Perspective means the ability to see the bigger picture in life. Perspective is about being able to see the forest as well as the trees, to avoid getting wrapped up in the small details when there are bigger issues to consider. While listening to others, perspective helps you to simultaneously think about life lessons, proper conduct, and what’s best for the situation being discussed. This ability to look at systems as a whole, or to think in big terms, helps you to offer good advice. Perspective is distinct from intelligence but represents a high level of knowledge, the capacity to give advice and to recognize and weight multiple sides before making decisions. It allows the individual to address important questions about the conduct and meaning of life.

### Courage
#### Bravery
"I act on my convictions, and I face threats, challenges, difficulties, and pains, despite my doubts and fears."

- Shows valor
- Doesn’t shrink from fear
- Speaks up for what’s right

To be brave is to face your challenges, threats, or difficulties. It involves valuing a goal or conviction and acting upon it, whether popular or not. A central element involves facing – rather than avoiding – fears.

There are three types of bravery (an individual may possess one of these or a combination):

- Physical bravery (e.g., firefighters, police officers, soldiers)
- Psychological bravery (e.g., facing painful aspects of oneself)
- Moral bravery (e.g., speaking up for what's right, even if it's an unfavorable opinion to a group)

#### Honesty
“I am honest to myself and to others, I try to present myself and my reactions accurately to each person, and I take responsibility for my actions.”

- Authentic
- Trustworthy
- Sincere

When you are honest, you speak the truth. More broadly, you present yourself in a genuine and sincere way, without pretense, and taking responsibility for your feelings and actions. You are a person of integrity — you are who you say you are — and you act consistently across the domains of your life rather than being one way in the community and a completely different way in your family. As a result, you believe you are being consistently true to yourself.

This strength involves accurately representing your internal states, intentions, and commitments, both publicly and privately. The strength of honesty is often linked to self-concordance- the extent to which your goals accurately represent your implicit interests and values. Honesty allows people to take responsibility for their feelings and behaviors, owning them, and reaping benefits by doing so.

#### Perseverance
"I persist toward my goals despite obstacles, discouragements, or disappointments."

- Persistent
- Industrious
- Finishes what one starts

Perseverance is sticking with things. It means being hardworking and finishing what is started, despite barriers and obstacles that arise. The pleasure received from completing tasks and projects is very important to those who are high in perseverance. Sometimes he or she must dig deep and muster the will to overcome thoughts of giving up. Perseverance involves organizing oneself to support activities (e.g., scheduling breaks and sticking to them, rewarding in small ways along the way), but when all else fails, this strength helps the person to barrel through until the project is done. This helps build further confidence for future successes and goal accomplishment. Perseverance involves the voluntary continuation of a goal-directed action despite the presence of challenges, difficulties, and discouragement. There are two vectors of perseverance. It requires both effort for a task and duration to keep the task up.

#### Zest
"I feel vital and full of energy, I approach life feeling activated and enthusiastic."

- Enthusiastic
- Energetic
- Doesn’t do things half-heartedly

Zest means approaching a situation, or life in general, with excitement and energy, not approaching tasks or activities halfway or halfheartedly. People who are high in zest are excited to get up in the morning, and they live their lives like an adventure. Zest is a dynamic strength that is directly related to physical and psychological wellness. This strength has the strongest ties to overall life satisfaction and a life of engagement.

### Humanity

#### Kindness
"I am helpful and empathic and regularly do nice favors for others without expecting anything in return."

- Generous
- Nurturing
- Caring
- Compassionate
- Altruistic

Simply put, kindness is being nice to others. As you examine kindness further, a number of important dimensions begin to unfold. Kindness is being generous with others, giving your time, money, and talent to support those who are in need. Kindness is being compassionate, which means to really be there for someone, listening intently to their suffering or just sitting with them and silently supporting them. Such compassion involves a deep concern for the welfare of others. Kindness is also being nurturing and caring to others — to enjoy doing favors for them, to take care of them, and to perform good deeds.

Kind individuals believe that others are worthy of attention and affirmation for their own sake as human beings, not out of a sense of duty or principle. There are three traits of altruistic personalities:

- Empathy/sympathy
- Moral reasoning
- Social responsibility

#### Love
"I experience close, loving relationships that are characterized by giving and receiving love, warmth, and caring."

- Warm and genuine,
- Values close relationships

After millions of songs and greeting cards, love needs no introduction. That said, we want to be clear about how the term is used in the VIA Classification. Love as a character strength, rather than as an emotion, refers to the degree to which you value close relationships with people, and contribute to that closeness in a warm and genuine way. Where kindness can be a behavioral pattern applied in any relationship, love as a character strength really refers to the way you approach your closest and warmest relationships. Love is reciprocal, referring to both loving others and the willingness to accept love from others. There are four types of love, each with a biological and evolutionary base:

- Attachment love: parent for child; child for parent
- Compassionate/altruistic love: kindness
- Companionate love: friendship
- Romantic love: spouse/partner/boyfriend/girlfriend

#### Social Intelligence
"I am aware of and understand my feelings and thoughts, as well as the feelings of those around me."

- Aware of the motives and feelings of others
- Knows what makes others tick

When a person knows what makes other people tick, he or she is displaying social intelligence. They’re aware of the motives and feelings of themselves and others, and how to fit into different social situations. They can feel comfortable and say the right thing whether they’re in the boardroom or the janitorial room, in a school setting or at a construction site. Social intelligence involves two general components:

- Social awareness: what we sense about others
- Social facility: what we do with our awareness

### Justice

#### Fairness
“I treat everyone equally and fairly, and give everyone the same chance applying the same rules to everyone.”

- Just
- Doesn’t let feelings bias decisions about others

Fairness is treating people justly, not letting your personal feelings bias your decisions about others. You want to give everyone a fair chance, and believe there should be equal opportunity for all, though you also realize that what is fair for one person might not be fair for another.

- Fairness is a cognitive judgment capacity that involves reasoning and making judgments. It involves 2 types of reasoning:
- Justice reasoning which emphasizes logic and weighing principles to determine moral rights and responsibilities.
- Care reasoning which includes empathy and compassion; the ability to put yourself in somebody else's shoes.

#### Leadership
"I take charge and guide groups to meaningful goals, and ensure good relations among group members."

- Organizes group activities
- Encourages a group to get things done

Leadership can take on many forms. As a character strength, leadership refers to the tendency to organize and encourage a group to get things done, while maintaining good relations within the group. Like teamwork, leadership involves being committed to the goals of the group, but how that commitment manifests itself is very different. Leadership involves setting goals and accomplishing them, enlisting effective help, building coalitions, and smoothing ruffled feathers. Effective leaders are able to provide a positive vision or message that inspires dedicated followers who feel empowered and perhaps even inspired. Leadership is a social phenomenon that can be distinguished into two areas:

- Practice- defining, establishing, identifying or translating direction
- Personal quality- the motivation and capacity to seek out, attain and carry out leader roles There are two types of leaders:
- Transactional leaders- this type of leader clarifies responsibilities, expectations, and the tasks to be accomplished
- Transformational leaders- this leader motivates their followers to perform at an extremely high level, fostering a climate of trust and commitment to the organization and its goals

#### Teamwork
"I am a helpful and contributing group and team member, and feel responsible for helping the team reach its goals."

- Team player
- Socially responsible
- Loyal

Teamwork means that in team situations you are committed to contributing to the team’s success. The team could be a work group or a sports team, but it could also refer to your family, marriage, or even a group of friends working on a project together. Teamwork extends to being a good citizen of your community or country, and more broadly to a sense of social responsibility for particular groups of people or even all of humanity. In other words, the person high in teamwork applies a certain way of acting in whatever context they consider themselves committed to the good of the group as a whole. Most commonly, however, this strength refers to your being a dedicated, reliable, and contributing member to your small group or team. Teamwork is closely related to 3 other concepts:

- Citizenship: responsibility toward one's community
- Loyalty: unwavering trust for a group
- Patriotism: loyalty toward one's homeland/nation without hostility toward other nations

### Temperance

#### Forgiveness
“I forgive others when they upset me and/or when they behave badly towards me, and I use that information in my future relations with them.”

- Merciful
- Accepts others’ shortcomings
- Gives people a second chance

Forgiveness means to extend understanding towards those who have wronged or hurt us. It means to let go. In many cases this is the letting go of some or all of the frustration, disappointment, resentment, or other painful feelings associated with an offense. Forgiveness, and the related quality of mercy, involve accepting the shortcomings, flaws, and imperfections of others and giving them a second (or third) chance. As the expression goes, it is letting bygones be bygones, rather than being vengeful. It is a process of humanizing those who have led us to feel dehumanized.

It is important to distinguish forgiveness from:
- condoning (removes the offense)
- forgetting (removes the awareness)
- reconciliation (restores the relationship)

#### Humility
"I see my strengths and talents but I am humble, not seeking to be the center of attention or to receive recognition."

- Modest
- Lets one’s accomplishments speak for themselves

Humility means accurately evaluating your accomplishments. It’s easy to describe what humility is not — it is not bragging, not doing things in excess, not seeking the spotlight, not drawing attention to yourself, not viewing yourself as more special or important than others. On the other hand, it is not bowing to every wish or demand of another person and it is not being highly self-critical. Truly humble people think well of themselves and have a good sense of who they are, but they also are aware of their mistakes, gaps in their knowledge, and imperfections. Most importantly, they are content without being a center of attention or getting praised for their accomplishments.

A common misconception is that humility involves having a low self-esteem, a sense of unworthiness, and/or a lack of self-focus. However, true humility involves an accurate self-assessment, recognition of limitations, keeping accomplishments in perspective, and forgetting of the self. Humble people do not distort information to defend or verify their own image, and they do not need to see-or present- themselves as being better than they actually are.

#### Prudence
"I act carefully and cautiously, looking to avoid unnecessary risks and planning with the future in mind.”

- Careful
- Cautious
- Doesn’t take undue risk

Prudence means being careful about your choices, stopping and thinking before acting. It is a strength of restraint. When you are prudent, you are not taking unnecessary risks, and not saying or doing things that you might later regret. If you are high in prudence, you are able to consider the long-term consequences of your actions. Prudence is a form of practical reasoning, the ability to examine the potential consequences of your actions objectively, and to control yourself based on that examination. Prudence involves far-sighted planning as well as short-term, goal-directed planning. It is often referred to as cautious wisdom, practical wisdom, and practical reason.

#### Self-Regulation
"I manage my feelings and actions and am disciplined and self-controlled."

- Self-controlled
- Manages impulses and emotions

Self-Regulation is a complex character strength. It has to do with controlling your appetites and emotions and regulating what you do. Those high in self-regulation have a good level of confidence in their belief that they can be effective in what they pursue and are likely to achieve their goals. They are admired for their ability to control their reactions to disappointment and insecurities. Self-regulation helps keep a sense of balance, order, and progress in life. Self-Regulation can be viewed as a resource that can be depleted and fatigued. A useful metaphor can be that self-regulation acts like a muscle, which can be exhausted through over-exertion or strengthened through regular practice.

### Transcendence

#### Appreciation of Beauty & Excellence
"I recognize, emotionally experience, and appreciate the beauty around me and the skill of others."

- Feels awe & wonder in beauty
- Inspired by goodness of others

Those who express an appreciation of beauty & excellence notice and appreciate beauty, excellence and/or skilled performance in all domains of life, from nature to art to mathematics to science to everyday experience.

People high in Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence are responsive to these three types of goodness:

- Physical Beauty.
This may include auditory, tactile or abstract. This type of goodness produces awe and wonder in the person experiencing it.

- Skill or Talent (Excellence).
This is often energizing, and compels a person to pursue their own goals. It inspires admiration.

- Virtue or moral goodness (moral beauty).
Virtuous goodness makes someone want to be better, more loving and creates feelings of elevation.

#### Gratitude
“I am grateful for many things and I express that thankfulness to others.”

- Thankful for the good
- Expresses thanks
- Feels blessed

The character strength of gratitude involves feeling and expressing a deep sense of thankfulness in life, and more specifically, taking the time to genuinely express thankfulness to others. This thankfulness can be for specific gifts or thoughtful acts. It could also more generally reflect recognition of what that person contributes to your life. We can be grateful for deliberate acts by others, such as a piece of art from a child, or for spontaneous treasures, such as a cool breeze on your face on a hot day. What marks gratitude is the psychological response: the transcendent feeling of thankfulness, the sense of having been given a gift by that person or event. Grateful people experience a variety of positive emotions, and those emotions inspire them to act in more virtuous ways – humbler, more persistent, or kinder. Gratitude tends to foster the character strengths of kindness and love, and therefore is closely associated with empathy and with connection to others.

There are two types of gratitude:

- Benefit-triggered gratitude= the state that follows when a desired benefit is received from a benefactor.
- Generalized gratitude= the state resulting from awareness and appreciation of what is valuable and meaningful to yourself. There are two stages of gratitude:

- Acknowledging the goodness in your life.

- Recognizing the source of this goodness is outside yourself.

#### Hope
“I am realistic and also full of optimism about the future, believing in my actions and feeling confident things will turn out well.”

- Optimistic
- Future-minded

The character strength of hope has to do with positive expectations about the future. It involves optimistic thinking and focusing on good things to come. Hope is more than a feel-good emotion. It is an action-oriented strength involving agency, the motivation and confidence that goals can be reached, and also that many effective pathways can be devised in order to get to that desired future. Optimism is closely linked with having a particular explanatory style (how we explain the causes of bad events). People using an optimistic explanatory style interpret events as internal, stable and global. Those using a pessimistic explanatory style interpret events as external, unstable and specific.

#### Humor
"I approach life playfully, making others laugh, and finding humor in difficult and stressful times."

- Playful
- Brings smiles to others
- Lighthearted

Humor means to recognize what is amusing in situations, and to offer the lighter side to others. Humor is an important lubricant to social interactions, and can contribute to team building or moving toward group goals. Where other strengths are more or less essential for achieving certain types of goals or dealing with certain types of problems, humor is rarely an essential component to positive social interactions, but it is often a desirable one. It is also a valuable method of coping with distressing situations.

Humor involves the ability to make other people smile or laugh. It also means having a composed and cheerful view on adversity that allows an individual to see its light side and thereby sustain a good mood.

#### Spirituality
"I feel spiritual and believe in a sense of purpose or meaning in my life; and I see my place in the grand scheme of the universe and find meaning in everyday life."

- Searches for meaning,
- Feels a sense of purpose
- Senses a relationship with the sacred

As is true for many of the character strengths in the VIA Classification, the strength of spirituality has many dimensions. Some of these include meaning, purpose, life calling, beliefs about the universe, the expression of virtue/goodness, and practices that connect with the transcendent. Spirituality has been defined consistently by scientists as the search for or connection with “the sacred”. The sacred might be that which is blessed, holy, revered, or particularly special. This can be secular or non-secular: sacredness might be pursued as the search for a purpose in life or as a close relationship with something greater; the sacred might be experienced in the forgiveness offered by a child, a humble moment between a leader and a subordinate, an awe-inspiring sunset, a profound experience during meditation or a religious service, or the self-sacrificing kindness of a stranger. As a character strength, spirituality involves the belief that there is a dimension to life that is beyond human understanding. Some people don’t connect this belief with the concept of a divinity and prefer to think of it in terms of a sense of meaning rather than spirituality, but in the VIA Classification the terms are considered closely related. Spirituality is believed to describe both the private, intimate relationship between humans and the divine, and the range of virtues that result from the relationships. Spirituality is universal. Although the specific content of spiritual beliefs varies, all cultures have a concept of an ultimate, transcendent, sacred force.
