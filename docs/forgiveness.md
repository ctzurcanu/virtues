# Forgiveness, Repentance


## Definition


- takes place only after Justice has been imparted
- Forgiveness is dependent upon signs of Repentance from the guilty party
- This action is the essence of Orthodox Christianity: one cannot spiritually digest the Eucharist without Repentance for all wrongdoings and/or solving all injustices one is aware of
- Forgiveness is the culmination of Justice rather than something that diminishes Justice

## Example of Application

### Scenario 1

Alex has damaged Bailey's property. Alex regrets this and pays back at least the market price of the damage incurred. Bailey acknowledges that the retribution is proportionate. 
Then Bailey decides to forgive Alex and gives Alex the money back.

## Philosophy

- Aristotle's syngnōmē: pardon after proportionate response
- the principle of epieikeia: a law can be broken to achieve a greater good
