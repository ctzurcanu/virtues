## Definition

### Measurability

- subtypes:
    - transparency
    - parsability
    - searchability
- attributes:

### Competition

- attendance
- level playing field
- if presided by jury: jury members won the same contest type
- data verifiability
- claim/challenge acceptance

### Selection

- natural selection
- natural evolution
- gene and phenotype selection

### Corruptions

- jury has not won the same contest type
- the playing field is not leveled or has hidden advantages for some contestants
- the data is abundant but it is not searchable: it only mimes transparency

## Dependencies

- Major
    - Abundance: without abundance, there can be no vital energy for Competition
    - Survival: selection implies the survival of the fittest 
    - Justice: natural selection is Natural Justice
