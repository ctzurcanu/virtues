- subtypes:
    - transparency
    - parsability
    - reflex
    - searchability (by reflex)
    - discrimination (by reflex)
    - standardization
    - interfacing
    - currency / money
- attributes:

### Competition

- attendance
- level playing field
- if presided by jury: jury members won the same contest type
- data verifiability
- claim/challenge acceptance

### Selection

- natural selection
- natural evolution
- gene and phenotype selection

### Reflex

- selection/judgement by reflex
- automated reaction
- subliminal mechanisms
- inherited abilities
- innate talent (in general)

### Corruptions

- jury has not won the same contest type
- the playing field is not leveled or has hidden advantages for some contestants
- the data is abundant but it is not searchable: it only mimes transparency
