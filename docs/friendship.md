# Friendship

## Requirements

- [being a citizen](citizen.html)

## Definitions

- allowing others to sustainably judge you conform to their ethos

- the act of doing virtuous evaluation and communication of the results to somebody else
- the act of creating the best conditions for receiving such evaluation
    - making your main output known in detail
    - evaluating virtuous criticism with Temperance
- the act of improving yourself concerning Virtues as a result of virtuous criticism (from without as well as from within)
- attributes
    - clarity: a friendship has to be declared at start and finish. If it is not conscious, it is not friendship

## Types

- self-friendship: you are your own friend while you observe, evaluate, and act to improve yourself concerning Virtues. If done often: it is the most powerful friendship.
- active friendship: offering to act as a friend. A provable volunteer makes such an offering to the whole world every time an output is published
- passive friendship: acting as a friend when the other party is in an obvious need
- "maybe friendship": it is a friendship that exists only in the imagination of one or both parties. It may become friendship if tested. Its existence is not beneficial to the concept of true friendship.

### Ideal Friendship

- is not personal: is mediated by Virtues
- is unforgiving to transgressions of Virtues 
- is not dependent on time or space
- is a verb, not a noun
- is known to exist (or not) for each relationship
- is not dependent on reciprocation
- is dependent on output
- exists towards institutions too
- cannot be created or sustained by those who are unable to have ideal friendships with institutions or concepts that are defined without (not an inner/subjective definition)
- The institution above does not have to be common between friends, but each (of the 2) has to be known mutually
