# Friendship

## Definitions

- the act of doing virtuous evaluation and communication of the results to somebody else
- the act of creating the best conditions for receiving such evaluation
    - making your main output known in detail
    - evaluating virtuous criticism with Temperance
- the act of improving yourself with respect to Virtues as result of virtuous criticism (from without as well as from within)
- attributes
    - clarity: a friendship has to be declared at start and finish. If it is not conscious, it is not friendship

## Types

- self-friendship: you are your own friend while you observe, evaluate, and act to improve with respect to Virtues. If done often: it is the most powerful friendship.
- active friendship: offering to act as a friend. A provable volunteer makes such an offering to the whole world every time an output is published
- passive friendship: acting as a friend when the other party is in an obvious need
- "maybe friendship": it is a friendship that exists only in the imagination of one or both parties. It may become friendship if tested. Its existence is not beneficial to the concept of true friendship.

### Ideal Friendship

- is not personal: is mediated by Virtues
- is unforgiving to transgressions of Virtues 
- is not dependent on time nor space
- is a verb, not a noun
- is known to exist (or not) for each relationship
- is not dependent on reciprocation
- is dependent on output
