# Virtues

## Definition

Virtues are not only qualitative concepts, they are quantitative. Because a perfection is not only characterized by quality, but also by quantity. Or: both quality and quantity have their own perfection and the common perfection is found at the intersection of the respective perfections.

We will name the lacking or the excess in each quality as Vices, and the mean as Virtues.

Qualitatively, a virtue has to be considered using the following criteria:
1. Has to be as atomic as possible.
1. To have a constructive dependence:
    1. To not diminish other virtues.
    1. To compose positively with other virtues (addition).
    1. To have synergy with other virtues (composition that values more than simple addition).
1. To have a dimension of measure where it occupies a mid-range. And the extremes are less moral.
1. On the dimension of measure: lack or be in excess in most cases.
1. To exist at some point instantated by some human.
1. To not exist for some human.
1. To exist in a group of humans, institution.
1. To have a name, concept, signifier, ritualistic act, or artistic depiction.


Quantitatively, we accept these definitions of virtue:
1. A range of values that are more beneficial than ranges smaller or greater.
1. A point in that range that maximizes the benefit according to the dimension of that virtue.
1. A point in that range that maximizes the benefit according to all virtues.
