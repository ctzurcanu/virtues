# Virtues

## Definition

Virtues are not only qualitative concepts, they are quantitative. Because a perfection is not only characterized by quality, but also by quantity. Or: both quality and quantity have their own perfection and the common perfection is found at the intersection of the respective perfections.

We will name the lacking or the excess in each quality as Vices, and the mean as Virtues.
