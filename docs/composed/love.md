# Love, Empathy

## Definition

Many virtues may have their root in Empathy: see [Reduction to 3 Concepts](../3concepts.md):

1. Faith, Reason
1. Charity
1. Hope
1. Prudence
1. Temperance
1. Justice

Its strongest influence is on Governance (as a composed virtue - one of the 3 concepts).

Love is Empathy and is a composed virtue. Many believe that it cannot be defined. They are right from the point of view of being in the experience, but there are meditation practices used to define it from outside, even while in the experience. We will attempt to analyze it without forcing an exact definition. We could conclude that there are 6 types of love, and we will identify them on the Anahata chakra yantra:

1. Agape
1. Storge
1. Platonic Love
1. Sexual Love
1. Love for Peers
1. Love for a Teacher/Student


## 1. Agape

[Agape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape) is "the love of God for man and of man for God". It is also the love you feel for universal values, the order of the Universe, and the unique hierarchy of all that exists. It is the love for Virtue.

## 2. Storge
[Storge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storge) or familial love refers to natural or instinctual affection, such as the love of a parent towards offspring and vice versa.

## 3. Platonic Love

[Platonic love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love) is a type of erotic/romantic love, and it concerns rising through levels of closeness to wisdom and true beauty, from carnal attraction to individual bodies to attraction to souls, and eventually, union with the truth. The sublimation of sexual love into Agape or Love for the Good.

## 4. Sexual Love

[Sexual love/Eros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_(concept)) is sensual or passionate love, from which the term erotic is derived. Eros has also been used in philosophy and psychology in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to "life energy". The pleasure of giving pleasure to the other.

## 5. Love for Peers
[Love for Peers/Philia of utility and pleasure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia), usually translated as "friendship" or affection, is of 3 types: the friendship of utility, the friendship of pleasure, and the friendship for the good (treated in part 6). The pleasure of being together in an ethos.

## 6. Love for a Teacher/Student

[Love a Teacher/Student/Philia for the good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia) is friendship for the good. It is a friendship where both friends enjoy each other's company. As long as both friends keep similar characters and moral hierarchy, the relationship will endure since the motive behind it is the transfer of ethical knowledge and building common sense. This is the highest level of philia and might be called true friendship. The pleasure of evolving civilization (or an ethos) together.

## 2 Active Substances

1. For Agape, Platonic Love, and Love for Teacher/Student, the active substance is **Serotonin**. 
1. For Storge, Sexual Love, and Love of Peers: it is **Oxytocin**. (With **Vasopressin** as a side-effect.)

## 12 Loves

In the practice of Raja and Kundalini Yoga, the discrimination of Empathy is deeper: Each of the 6 types is further isolated into the receiving and the emitting modes.
